    <h1>AI FAQs</h1>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>1. How do cloud platforms enable the storage and processing of large datasets required for real-world AI projects?</h2>
      <p>Cloud platforms enable large-scale AI projects by offering scalable storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob), elastic compute resources (e.g., VMs, GPUs, TPUs), and big data tools (e.g., Hadoop, Spark). They provide managed AI services for model training, real-time data processing, and integration via ETL tools. Cost-effective, secure storage tiers and compliance ensure data safety, while collaboration tools and open-source compatibility enhance productivity. This flexibility makes them ideal for handling massive datasets efficiently.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>4. How do web applications facilitate the integration of AI models into end-user environments for real-world applications?</h2>
      <p>Web applications enable seamless integration of AI models into real-world environments by providing accessible, interactive interfaces for end-users. They simplify data input, model execution, and result visualization through user-friendly dashboards. Web APIs facilitate backend integration with other systems, while responsive designs ensure compatibility across devices. Additionally, real-time updates, scalability, and secure deployment make web apps ideal for delivering AI-powered solutions to diverse end-user contexts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>5. How do cloud-based AI services simplify model training, deployment, and monitoring in real-world scenarios?</h2>
      <p>Cloud-based AI services simplify model training with managed tools supporting scalable compute (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) and pre-built frameworks. Deployment is streamlined through APIs, containerization, and serverless options for seamless integration. Real-time monitoring tools provide insights into model performance, enabling adjustments and error tracking. Auto-scaling, cost optimization, and security ensure reliability, making it easier to manage AI projects in dynamic real-world environments.</p>
